## üéØ Problem Statement

AtliQ Hospitality has been losing market share and revenue in recent months. The management lacks a clear, data-driven view of their performance across different properties, cities, and booking platforms. They need a unified dashboard to answer critical business questions like:

- What are the key drivers of revenue?
- Which properties are performing best or worst?
- How is the occupancy rate trending over time?
- What is the impact of different booking platforms on revenue and cancellations?
- How can we optimize pricing and room allocation based on demand?

    * `fact_aggregated_bookings`: Contains aggregated daily data for bookings and capacity.
* **Dimension Tables:**
    * `dim_date`: Contains date-related information (week number, day type, month, etc.).
    * `dim_hotels`: Contains details about each hotel property (name, city, category).
    * `dim_rooms`: Contains details about room categories.
